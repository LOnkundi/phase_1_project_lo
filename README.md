# Phase_one_project_lo
## Overview
This project focuses analyses company need to expand into aviation but is not sure of the 
aircraft to purchase and the risk involved on the options they’ll go for.
 • We went into answering this questions by identifying the safest 
aircraft to purchase through data analysis


## Objectives
To apply our analysis and outcome from the aircraft 
incident data 
• Identify low risk aircraft from patterns and trends 
of the analyzed data
 • provide insights and recommendation for decision 
making in aircraft purchase


## Data set
 Our aviation data, sourced from the National Transportation Safety 
Board has 90348 rows and 31 columns
 • The key features that stood count on the columns for our analysis 
were the make and model of the aircrafts, number of accidents 
coursed and the type of injuries(minor, major &fatal) incurred.
 • We checked out for null values, dropped columns with high missing 
values and filled in figures on nulls for columns of interest.
 • We used tools like numpy, pandas for the analysis and graphical 
presentation for visualization.


## Exploration
For visualization, we used bar charts for the analysis of model and 
make  in comparison to total uninjured
 • A line graph for the analysis of total injured, total uninjured over time
 • Finally, a pie chart that gave analysis of top causes of incidences
 

 ## Insight and Findings
 We found that most accidents occurred at take-off, when cruising and  
when approaching landing
 • Highest number of injuries occurred in the years 1982,1996 and 2000 
but subsided of the years.
 • We also deduced from the bar graph that the models and make with 
the highest number of uninjured were Cessna and Piper

## Conclussion and recommendations
 From the analysis, we find that 
• Cessna and Piper models stood out as the optimal models for 
consideration as they posed the least risk over the years
 • They have the highest safety record with low damage rates
 Further findings on aircraft operation together with the cost benefit 
analysis is recommended
